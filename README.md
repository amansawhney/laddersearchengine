## App Summary 
My friend Mar Gabriel Tabilla was working for a company Ladder.io. His task was to build an internal tool to assit with data organization and record keeping. He built an API using Ruby on Rails which allows for data entry and serves a JSON file. In addition to this he needed a front end to display and allow for quick lookup of the data that is both efficient and easy to use. I built that using ReactJS and is now used internally at Ladder.io
